            <p>Hey! I'm Plover Brown. I'm a web developer working out of San Diego. These clear blue skies with picturesque, fluffy clouds are great inspiration for sharp, clean coding! I recommend it.</p>
            <p>I've been working in Python on my own for the past year or so, but I'm always looking for something new to learn, so here I am studying full stack web development with UCSD Extensions! I come from an untraditional background, with a B.A. in studio art and sociology, so I've learned to keep my eyes and ears open for fresh and unusual opportunities. That's how I ended up coding while my four year old rampages around being a lightning-breathing dragon in the background.</p>
            <p>Keep an eye out, because I'm going to be filling this portfolio up with work in no time.</p>
