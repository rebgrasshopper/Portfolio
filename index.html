                        <p>Hey! I'm Plover Brown.</p>
                        <p>I'm a web developer working out of San Diego. These clear blue skies with picturesque, fluffy clouds are great inspiration for sharp, clean coding! I recommend it.</p>
                        <p>I've been working in Python on my own for the past year or so, but I'm always looking for something new to learn, I just completed the Full Stack Web Developer Bootcamp at UCSD Extensions! It was extremely fun. I got to become conversant in JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Node.js, rDBs and no-SQL databases, react, and more.</p>
                        <p>I come from an untraditional background, with a B.A. in studio art and sociology, so I've learned to keep my eyes and ears open for fresh and unusual opportunities. That's how I ended up coding while my four year old rampages around being a lightning-breathing dragon in the background.</p>
                        <p>My most recent project has been a classic text-based MUD, built from the ground up with a great team of coders! <a href="https://innattheedge.herokuapp.com/" target="_blank">Inn At The Edge of Copyright</a> is currently on Version 1, and we're quite happy with our result from a 12 day sprint working together, but also eagerly looking forward to our next features. Working on a dedicated team is such a great time - probably my favorite part of coding!</p>
