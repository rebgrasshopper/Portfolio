**Personal Portfolio**

This is a simple and clear page meant to provide an easy look at the projects in my portfolio and some basic information about me, as well as a way to contact me.

Currently I am using html and css only, so it should run on any browser.

I want to apply the GNU General Public License, but I'm not yet sure how.
